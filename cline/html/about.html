            <p>Happiness is just a choice!
                The art of happiness is about asking questions. When you ask a question, even a simple one such as,
                “What else is possible here that I’ve never considered?” you open the door to new possibilities opening up that you couldn’t see before.
                <br><br>
                Happiness is just a choice. One you can make now. Be willing to choose it, every 10 seconds. It takes practice. Recognize that just because much of the world chooses to be unhappy doesn’t mean you have to too. Be willing to be different
                and in most places, happy is different. Never underestimate the power of asking questions. Questions can change anything. What would it take to live every day as a celebration? Don’t be afraid to ask that question. You might just find your life starts getting better!</p>
